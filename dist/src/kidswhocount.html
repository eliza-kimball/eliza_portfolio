                  Kids Who Count is a local non-profit charity offering services for
                  children, such as early intervention, mental health, and
                  vision/screening support. The charity’s mission is to support child
                  development and empower families by providing necessary resources
                  allowing children to reach their unique individual potential. The
                  original site was challenging to navigate and lacked visual and
                  functional appeal. I aimed to create a site that supports parents
                  and families through visual and functional elements.

          <p>
              I began the redesign process with a site audit of the original site
              to determine what the problems were. Pain points include navigation,
              visual appeal, and layout. I then looked at other non-profits for
              inspiration and best practices, this inspired a mood board. I
              decided on a potential color scheme that portrayed feelings of
              happiness, friendliness, and genuineness. I also added examples of
              other sites I liked—colors, layout, or overall feeling. The mood
              board lays out my initial ideas while providing continual
              inspiration and sparking ideas.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Content Creation</h3>

          <p>
            In the next step, I took general and incomplete ideas and began to
            form them into complete thoughts. I decided on font and font sizes,
            color and gradients, and potential buttons, navigation, forms,
            icons, and logos. This created my pattern library to help guide my
            next couple of steps.

                  Low-fidelity wireframes are created next and used to establish layout, structure, and organization. No colors or pictures are used to keep it simple and straightforward. I was able to take all of the inspiration, ideas, and content I had received and make it multiple complete pages. I received feedback from my peers in order to continue to improve and develop my wireframes.

        <p>
          Once I edited and reedited my wireframes, I began to add color and pictures, and redesigned any elements that looked out of place. Surface comps are one of the final stages and display what my site will actually look like. After I finished each page, I created a high-fidelity, clickable prototype. I could see how my pages are connected, linked to one another, and active navigation. This was the final and most satisfying stage of the Kids Who Count redesign.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Conclusion</h3>

        <p>
          Although my charity redesign was not used, I learned from the experience and process of redesigning a site. Practicing and working through each step helped me gain crucial skills and insight I would not otherwise have. I refined navigation and created a visually appealing site that is happy, uplifting, and welcoming.        </p>
