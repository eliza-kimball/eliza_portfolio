              Svelte is a powerful framework for building web interfaces by
              converting code into optimized vanilla JavaScript for improved
              performance. Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework,
              accelerates styling by providing ready-to-use classes, making it
              easier to create responsive and customizable designs. When I was
              tasked with rebuilding components with Svelte and Tailwind, this
              presented an exciting challenge, especially since I was new to
              both tools. Through persistence and a process of trial and error,
              I successfully crafted a component that effectively leverages the
              strengths of both Svelte and Tailwind.

          <p>
            The component I rebuilt is a popup for entering a team name. To
            promote reusability, I broke the popup down into smaller, manageable
            elements, starting with the button element. I decided to create
            three different button variants—regular, dark, and flat—to
            accommodate different design needs.

        <p class="mt-4 font-semibold">How it works: </p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                <li>Conditional Rendering: The code above uses Svelte’s {#if} blocks to determine which button variant to display on the type variable. If the type is regular, dark, or flat, this is the corresponding button that is displayed.</li>
                <li>Styling with Tailwind: CSS classes are used within the class attribute. Each variant has unique styling such as color, hover, and size. </li>
            </ul>
        <p>This approach allowed me to build a versatile and reusable button component. By breaking the popup into distinct elements and leveraging Svelte’s reactivity along with Tailwind CSS’s utility-first styling, I was able to create a component that is both efficient and easy to integrate into other parts of the application.</p>
        </div>

        <!--4th-->
        <div class="space-y-4 mt-6">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Popup Component</h3>
            <p>
                After developing both the input and button elements as reusable custom components, I integrated them with structured HTML to create the popup. I leveraged Svelte’s conditional rendering to craft two distinct themes—light and dark.
            </p>
            <p>
                For each theme, a container div wraps the popup content and is styled using Tailwind CSS to define its width, background color, border, padding, and margin. Inside this container, an h1 element displays the title while a p element offers additional context, ensuring a clear separation between content and style for easy management and layout adjustments.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4 font-semibold">To complete the popup, I incorporated custom components for user interaction:</p>
            
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                <li>MyInput: This component is used for entering the team name and adapts to the theme via the type attribute.</li>
                <li>MyButton: Two button components provide "Confirm" and "Cancel" actions. Their styling varies based on the type and size attributes, ensuring a consistent and theme-appropriate appearance.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This approach simplified the development process and allowed me to reuse elements in other components, ensuring consistency and efficiency. </p>

            <p>
                One challenge I had was managing the export button properties. Initially exporting elements like name, type, size, and color and ensuring they interacted correctly with the component logic was tricky. However, through persistent trial and error and experimenting with Svelte’s syntax, I eventually mastered the logic and was able to customize the button components effectively. Working on this project while simultaneously learning JavaScript gave me a much clearer understanding of Svelte’s export mechanism.

                class="w-full max-w-md mx-auto rounded-lg shadow-md" />
        
            <p>
                Another challenge I encountered was understanding how to properly import the necessary components. Initially, I struggled with importing the correct elements and integrating them into the popup component. However, after some trial and error and a deeper dive into Svelte’s import syntax, I was able to seamlessly pull in and use the imported elements.

            <p>
                In this case study, I built a popup component using Svelte and Tailwind CSS. Although I faced challenges with exporting and importing elements, I managed to create a flexible component with both light and dark themes. In the future, I plan to simplify the structure even more and improve accessibility. This project helped me learn about Svelte and Tailwind, and it has set a solid foundation for further improvements in my component design.
