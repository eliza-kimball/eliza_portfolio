            JavaScript powers the interactive aspects of websites, and this
            skill was exactly what I needed when tasked with building a weather
            application where users can retrieve and display real-time data
            based on a zip code. My goal was to create a user-friendly interface
            that could fetch data from a weather API and update dynamically
            based on user input. The application features a clean design and
            intuitive controls, allowing users to effortlessly check the weather
            for different locations without any technical complexity.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Displaying Real-Time Weather Data</h3>

          <p>
            First, I needed to fetch remote JSON data for real-time weather
            updates. Before this project, my experience was limited to
            retrieving local data using JavaScript. I stored my API key in myKey
            and used template literals to construct myPath, dynamically
            embedding the zip code. Using fetch(), I retrieved weather data from
            the OpenWeatherMap API, converted it to JSON, and passed it to
            currentWeather() to update the UI.
          </p>

              The currentWeather() function extracts JSON data to display key
              weather details, including the city name, date, weather icon, and
              other relevant information. After successfully retrieving and
              displaying the data, I encountered several challenges.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Challenges</h3>

          <p>
            One of the first challenges I faced was allowing users to enter a
            new zip code dynamically. I decided to implement an interactive icon
            that, when clicked, would open a card where users could input a new
            zip code. Through trial and error, I successfully connected my
            JavaScript to my HTML, enabling seamless UI manipulation. By using
            querySelector() to target the modal and settings icon, I toggled the
            visibility of the input card with a simple event listener.
          </p>

          <!-- Image below the first paragraph -->
          <img
            src="../images/weather3.png"
            alt="Fetching Weather Data"
            class="w-full max-w-lg mx-auto"
          />

          <p>
            After implementing an event listener to update the zip code when the
            "Set New Zip Code" button was clicked, I realized I hadnâ€™t accounted
            for a default zip code. Rather than hardcoding a default, I wanted a
            more user-friendly approach. This led me to explore local storage,
            allowing the application to remember the last zip code entered. By
            checking if a stored ZIP code exists, the script either retrieves
            the previous entry or sets a default value, ensuring a seamless user
            experience when revisiting the site.

              This is the page after integrating HTML and JavaScript. While it
              successfully updates and reloads new data dynamically, the initial
              interface felt plain, unstructured, and unintuitive. To enhance
              usability, I applied CSS to introduce color, typography, and
              card-based layouts, making the design more visually appealing and
              user-friendly. The improved font selection enhances readability,
              while the carefully chosen colors create a calm and inviting user
              experience.

            <p>Building this weather application was a transformative learning experience that deepened my understanding of JavaScript, API integration, and user interface design. Throughout the process, I faced challenges such as retrieving remote data, dynamically updating the UI, and enhancing user experience with CSS and local storage. Overcoming these obstacles not only strengthened my technical skills but also reinforced my ability to problem-solve and adapt. This project serves as a testament to my proficiency in leveraging web technologies to create interactive, user-friendly applications.</p>
