                Advisors at UVU’s School of Education recognized that students were struggling to navigate their advising website due to its cluttered and disorganized layout. The current page lacked clear information for both current and prospective students, leading to several challenges:
            </p>
    
            <p class="mt-4 font-semibold">Difficulty finding essential details such as:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                <li>Course requirements</li>
                <li>Available programs</li>
                <li>Assigned academic advisors</li>
            </ul>
    
            <p class="mt-4 font-semibold">Miscommunication and scheduling errors, where students:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                <li>Confused SOE counseling with First-Year Advising</li>
                <li>Scheduled appointments with the wrong advisors</li>
            </ul>
    
            <p class="mt-4">
                To address these issues, a redesign was necessary to create a more structured and user-friendly page that effectively directs students to the appropriate advisors and presents program information clearly and organized.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">User Research</h3>
        <p>Before making changes to the site, my team and I conducted a website audit, reviewed its requirements, and identified potential users. This helped us plan updates effectively and uncover additional pain points.</p>
    
        <!-- Surveys Section -->
        <h4 class="font-semibold mt-6">Surveys</h4>
        <p>Survey results revealed that most students access the advising website using a laptop or tablet, leading to the decision to prioritize a wide-screen layout. Additionally, since students typically visit the advising site at least once per semester, it reinforced the need for a clean and easy-to-navigate design.</p>

        <!-- Interviews Section -->
        <h4 class="font-semibold mt-6">Interviews</h4>
        <p>Interviews with six students showed that freshmen visit the advising site frequently, while upperclassmen rely more on myUVU to access their advisors. This highlighted the importance of clearly directing first-year students to the correct advisor and reducing misdirected appointments.</p>
    
        <!-- Eye-Tracking Section -->
        <h4 class="font-semibold mt-6">Eye-Tracking Testing</h4>
        <p>An eye-tracking test with two students confirmed navigation challenges, particularly in locating the first-year advisor. One student took two minutes to find the information and eventually gave up. The test also revealed that usability issues extend beyond the SOE advising page, validating concerns about the overall accessibility of essential advising information.</p>

    <div class="space-y-4 mt-6">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">High-Fidelity Design</h3>
        <p>After finalizing the site map and layout, we enhanced the design with colors, images, and refinements. Creating surface comps allowed us to develop a clickable prototype, giving students a realistic browsing experience. Key improvements included highlighting advisor information at the top, streamlining content, redesigning the navigation bar, and adding a student resources page with an FAQ section. These changes aimed to make the site more user-friendly and easier to navigate.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Testing and Validation</h3>
            <p>
                We tested our initial prototype with students using the same tasks from the eye-tracking test to collect comparable data. 
                The results showed significant improvements—students found information much faster, with the time to locate the first-year advisor decreasing from 2 minutes to just 15-30 seconds.
            </p>
            <p>
                While all participants completed the tasks, some suggested further refinements, such as making the first-year advisor more prominent and enhancing navigation clarity. 
                This feedback reinforced the importance of continuous testing and iteration to create the most effective redesign.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>One of the main challenges in redesigning the advising site was ensuring we fully understood students' needs from the start. In hindsight, we could have spent more time gathering initial user feedback, and refining survey and interview questions to collect more specific insights.        </p>
        <p>Despite this, the redesign process was a rewarding experience, especially working collaboratively with my team. Each member brought unique strengths, and our discussions led to valuable improvements. While I typically prefer working independently, this project showed me the power of collaboration and how leveraging different skills leads to stronger results. Ultimately, this experience enhanced my design skills and appreciation for teamwork in the design process.
